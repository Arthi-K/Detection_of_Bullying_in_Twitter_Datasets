# Detection_of_Bullying_in_Twitter_Datasets
Pattern recognition and classification of tweets that include messages that may be part
of cyber bullying can help curtail the hate speech on social media platforms and make
it a safer environment for the younger generation. The selection of data, specifically
tweets, from the operational database is done before the excavation phase. The data selection is based on datasets
fetched from Twitter using live API, that can help pull data to the system suitably.
The datasets are cleaned and transformed according to the requirements of the
modules. The transformed datasets are then subjected to data mining techniques of
recognizing a common pattern in the selected case of crime, cyber bullying. The need
for implementation of intelligent solutions like these will cast off the burden of
manual investigations.
